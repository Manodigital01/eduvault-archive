/**
 * Deterministic fixtures for rare failure modes and their repair paths (#881).
 *
 * Each fixture is a minimal, self-contained set of documents that reproduces
 * one rare but important failure state exactly as the integrity monitor
 * (scripts/lib/integrity-rules.mjs) sees it, plus the documented repair path.
 * `tests/backend/failure-fixtures.test.mjs` proves that every fixture
 *   - satisfies the current `$jsonSchema` validators (users, materials),
 *   - is detected by exactly the integrity rules it declares,
 *   - and, for automated/script repairs, is cleared by its repair path.
 *
 * Side-effect free (no DB connection on import), like integrity-rules.mjs.
 * All `_id`s start with `fa11ed` so fixture rows are easy to spot and remove,
 * and all timestamps are fixed offsets from FIXTURE_NOW.
