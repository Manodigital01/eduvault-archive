# EduVault API Error Code Reference

This document contains the event/integration error registry for purchase,
entitlement, download, refund, storage, indexer, webhook, activity
receipts, and delegated recovery contacts. It is not the canonical HTTP API response schema.

The current HTTP Problem Details schema, route coverage, operational
remediation, and stable API error codes are documented in
[API Problem Details and Error Codes](./api-problem-details.md). In
particular, `EVT_*` registry identifiers below are not aliases for the HTTP
`code` field.

---

## Event / integration registry format

The following envelope describes the event/integration registry only; HTTP API
errors use the RFC 9457 envelope in the linked API documentation:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "EVT_PURCHASE_004",
    "message": "Human-readable description (informational only).",
    "retryable": false,
    "supportAction": "contact_support"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `string` | Stable machine-readable code. Never changes within a major version. |
| `message` | `string` | Informational prose. May change. Do not parse. |
| `retryable` | `boolean` | `true` when the same request may succeed if retried after a delay. |
| `supportAction` | `string \| null` | Suggested next step. See [Support Actions](#support-actions). |

## Recovery Contact Errors (`EVT_RECOVERY_`)

Recovery contacts are trusted peers a student invites to help restore
access to their own records and learning assets. The flow is strictly
opt-in and delegated:

1. Student invites a contact (`invited`).
2. Contact accepts (`active`) or rejects (`declined`) the invite.
3. Student requests recovery and active contacts approve or reject.
4. Approvals expire or can be revoked before completion.

A contact cannot approve or reject a recovery request until it has
accepted its invite. Expired or revoked approvals fail safely and cannot be
used to complete restoration. Every recovery action is audited with the
actor, the action type, and a reason metadata field.

| Code | HTTP | Retryable | Description | Support Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EVT_RECOVERY_001` | 403 | false | Contact not confirmed — the recovery contact has not accepted its invite and cannot act on requests. | `none` |

| `EVT_RECOVERY_007` | 409 | false | Recovery request revoked — the student revoked the request before approval completed. | `none` |
| `EVT_RECOVERY_008` | 409 | false | Approval expired — the contact's approval passed its expiry and cannot be counted. | `none` |
| `EVT_RECOVERY_009` | 409 | false | Approval revoked — the contact or student revoked the approval before completion. | `none` |
| `EVT_RECOVERY_010` | 403 | false | Contact is not a confirmed recovery contact — the actor is not in the account's confirmed recovery set. | `none` |
